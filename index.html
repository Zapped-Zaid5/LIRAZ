            <div class="info-grid">
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Basic Information</h4>
                    <p>Liraz Nanaz is one of the two main protagonists in <span class="highlight">Revival: Lost</span>, alongside his brother Zaril. Both brothers are <span class="highlight">60 years old</span> and have been separated since they were 10 due to their intense rivalry.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Humorous Education</h4>
                    <p>While Zaril has a PhD in Psychology, Liraz claims to have a <span class="highlight">PhD in "floor"</span> as a witty retort during their Uno match competitions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Separation</h3>
            <p>The brothers' rivalry was so intense they were "about to nuke the world to win" when they were just 10 years old. Responsible parents separated them for <span class="highlight">50 years</span>. They are eventually reunited by <span class="highlight">The Diabolic</span>, who uses their current trauma and places money around to bring them back together.</p>
            
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>Liraz is portrayed as the <span class="highlight">"scavenger brother"</span> who is <span class="highlight">chill</span> and "vibes" with the new female Genie character. He finds humor in situations, particularly finding Zaril's nickname "nerdillious Wierdo" (given by the Genie) to be hilarious.</p>
            
            <p>He's competitive and uses various taunts and strategies during games, but he also finds competitions boring after extended periods. Despite this, he continues to engage with Zaril's challenges, showing both his competitive spirit and his occasional weariness with their constant rivalry.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Motivation</h3>
            <p>Like Zaril, Liraz's primary motivation is his <span class="highlight">rivalry with his brother</span>. Their obsession with competing against each other literally keeps them alive in the haunted house. The game explores the theme: <span class="highlight">"What is the result of obsession?"</span></p>
            
            <p>If one brother dies, the other also dies because without the competition, they lose their reason to avoid the ghosts. They need <span class="highlight">competition, not cooperation</span>, to survive - their rivalry is their lifeline.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay & Abilities</h2>
            
            <h3>Environmental Combat System</h3>
            <div class="ability-list">
                <h4>Scavenger Combat Style</h4>
                <p>Liraz focuses on using <span class="highlight">the environment and found items</span> to defeat enemies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Yeet cardboard boxes</span> - Throws boxes at enemies like the daughter to stun them</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Throw dust</span> - Uses dust to suffocate enemies</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Inventory management</span> - Must strategically manage found items</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Environmental awareness</span> - Uses surroundings as weapons</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Note: Unlike Zaril, Liraz cannot use enemy remains in combat.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Trash Talk System</h3>
            <div class="ability-list">
                <h4>Verbal Combat Mechanics</h4>
                <p>Liraz and Zaril use <span class="highlight">trash talk as a survival mechanic</span> against ghosts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Utter ignorance</span> - Causes panic in enemies</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Quipping</span> - Creates confusion</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Insulting</span> - Disrupts ghost behavior</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Breakdancing</span> - Disorients enemies</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Upgradeable Stats:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vocabulary</li>
                    <li>Volume control</li>
                    <li>Delivery Timing</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Liraz's trash talk can be <span class="highlight">combined with dust combos</span> for enhanced effectiveness. Trash talking certain family members can trigger protective frenzies from other ghosts.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Genie Wish System</h3>
            <p>Liraz can use wishes granted by the Genie to obtain unique items such as <span class="highlight">"gold cord pizza"</span> or a <span class="highlight">giant flashlight to blind family members</span>, complementing his environmental combat style.</p>

            <h3>Notable Competition Moments</h3>
            <div class="info-grid">
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Uno Strategy</h4>
                    <p>Attempts to use multiple skip and reverse cards against Zaril but ultimately loses when Zaril uses a "swap decks" card. Liraz forgets to say "Uno" at a crucial moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Sleep Contest Victory</h4>
                    <p>After the Uno match, Liraz agrees to a sleep contest with Zaril and <span class="highlight">wins</span>, loudly celebrating his victory over his brother.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Connect 4 Tactics</h4>
                    <p>Initiates a Connect 4 match and plays strategically, attempting to trap Zaril's pieces and create chains, but ultimately loses to his brother's psychology tactics.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Culinary Challenge</h4>
                    <p>Participates in cook-offs with Zaril, attempting to make <span class="highlight">Chicken Tikka Masala</span> using detailed recipes during their culinary competitions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Genie Interactions</h3>
            <p>Liraz is described as <span class="highlight">"vibing"</span> with the Genie character, showing a more relaxed and friendly approach compared to Zaril's initially skeptical attitude. He finds entertainment in the Genie's nicknames for his brother.</p>
            
            <h3>Game Endings & Lore Role</h3>
            <p>Liraz can be the protagonist who escapes, cures family members, or interacts with the Mother in various game endings. However, in certain bad endings, if he goes "too deep" in the secret parts of the game, <span class="highlight">The Diabolic will take him as his vessel</span> to destroy the universe.</p>
            
            <p>In the "Bevrious" sequence, if Liraz and Zaril reach the Sinus section, they are dismembered and die. At the CANON end of the game, both brothers eventually join a <span class="highlight">multiversal anti-diabolic group</span>.</p>
            
            <h3>Media Presence & Voice Acting</h3>
            <p>Liraz is featured in the game's main theme song, described as a rap battle between him and Zaril. He's also depicted on the potential box art in a sword fight with his brother, with Sinus looking at a family photo behind him.</p>
            
            <p>The game's creator, Zapped Zaid, <span class="highlight">hopefully casts Jason Griffith</span> to voice Liraz Nanaz, though this is wishful thinking and not yet guaranteed.</p>
